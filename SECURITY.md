# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is actively supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not post vulnerabilities publicly in issues.
- Report privately to project maintainers first.
- Include clear reproduction steps and impact.
- If possible, provide a minimal proof-of-concept.

Maintainers will acknowledge reports and coordinate a fix/release timeline.
